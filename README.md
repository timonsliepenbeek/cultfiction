# Limitless MTA is a roleplay gamemode designed and coded by
# Timon Sliepenbeek <timonsliepenbeek@gmail.com>. It's aim is to let go of
# existing boundaries and allow community contributions to fast-forward RP
# gamemode development. Anno 2016 a lot of roleplay servers limit
# themselves to moderate RP scripts when the beauty of MTA is it's endless
# script limitations of the powerful LUA programming language.
#
# If you're going to make changes to the source code be a sport and branch it :)
